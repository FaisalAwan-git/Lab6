# Lab6
In this lab, I learned how to manage branches directly on GitHub. I created new branches, edited files, and handled merge conflicts when two branches edited the same line. I also used pull requests to merge changes and viewed the repository’s commit history using the network graph. This experience improved my understanding of collaborative coding using Git and GitHub’s web interface.
